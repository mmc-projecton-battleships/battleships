Reset(); // interrupt{called by key}. - > 8051. -> the function will restart the whole system.
Reset();// interrupt -> ARM -> reset all.
Init();//8051,ARM -> initialization
LCD_Init();8051,ARM
KEYPAD_INIT();//8051
make_ships(int [][] ships, int ships_size);//ARM -> an RND function wich makes ships.
ships = array[ship index][position num 1~3]//ARM-> a "ship" is presented by an array.
hit();//interrput{called by key}. -> 8051. -> send the ARM
write_hit(int[3] ship);//8051 -> writes "X" on the ship.
check_hit();//ARM-> check if there was a hit and return feedback to the 8051.
send_ship()//ARM-> send ship position after 8051 its it.
get_ship(int []);//8051 -> get hitted ship position and print X.
send_time();//ARM->send the time to the 8051.
get_time();//8051->get time via UART.
Game_Over(bool win);//ARM-> send the 8051 that he lost/won.
Game_Over(bool win);//8051 -> go to GameOver/winning Screen.
screen_data ()// will show time and mistakes left
screen_start ()// will show 4 levels of difficulty
screen_win  ()//"you're a winner"
screen_lost  ()//"game over"
screen_map_one()//upper half of the map
screen_map_sec ()// sec half of the map
main_loop();8051,ARM->the main loop of the flow.
show_data(int time, int mistakes);8051,ARM-> show time and mistakes left on the "data screen" of 8051/ARM.
		mainly used to "refresh" data in screen_data.
valid_position(x,y,z,t,size);//ARM-> checks of the inserted position is ok for the ship size.(z,t) is the next point[insert (-1) if the ship is one char size].
map[16][4] --- map[x][y] represent the state of game.
